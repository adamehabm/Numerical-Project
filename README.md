# Numerical-Project
This is my 3rd term Numerical Methods project that i made last semester, where i was tasked with creating a program that asks the user to enter a mathematical function and to choose a Numerical Method to be carried out on the inputed function, to ultimately find it's root and display the results with steps inside a table as the output.
